1. fill value is not related with RUNSF, the old code is.
2. units for swe is stored as mm, as discussed at last meeting. Should bring this up

3. Should the code check if a variable exists before copying? Or rather, we should know
   advance that these variables should exist. Otherwise, it should abort already.
