1. fill value is not related with RUNSF, the old code is.
2. units for swe is stored as mm, as discussed at last meeting. Should bring this up
   again for the next meeting.
3. Should the code check if a variable exists before copying? Or rather, we should know
   advance that these variables should exist. Otherwise, it should be an error.
4. CF-1.6 is for the old code, do we stick to it? The latest is CF-1.7
